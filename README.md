## 1. OVERVIEW

`awsomdesktop` is a collection of automation tools written in Python and
originally developed by Peter Fison (https://github.com/PFython) for use at
South West London TV Ltd as part of their Adobe Creative Cloud video production
workflow.

These desktop tools contained in this package are part of a larger suite of apps
collectively known as **AWSOM**, which stands for:

**A**mazing **W**ays to **S**earch and **O**rganise **M**edia.

This package contains a mixture of OS-independent Python scripts for managing
common automation tasks such as renaming media files and making backups, as well
as some exciting automations built on top of the superb `Pymiere` library by
Quentin Masingarbe (https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere).  Unfortunately
`Pymiere` currently only supports Window 10, so those automations are limited
to Windows users for now.

If you're interested in exploring the rest of the **AWSOM** toolkit, which is
primarily aimed at serious YouTubers, video editors, and power-users of online
video generally such as journalists, researchers, and teachers, please follow us

Both `awsomdesktop` and a snazzy new web version we hope to launch soon provide a
tonne of powerful features completely free, but additional 'Pro' features like
Automatic Speech Recognitio/Subtitling use third party services and may require
a registered account with us or them to access on a pay-per-use basis.


## 2. INSTALLATION

Very lightweight with only two dependencies (`cleverdict` and `pymiere`):

    pip install awsomdesktop

or to cover all bases...

    python -m pip install awsomdesktop --upgrade --user

## 3. BASIC USE

## 10. UNDER THE BONNET

`awsomdesktop` makes use of `CleverDict`, a handy custom data type which allows
developers to flexibly switch between Python dictionary `{key: value}` notation
and `object.attribute` notation.  For more information about `CleverDict` see:
https://pypi.org/project/cleverdict/
