## 1. OVERVIEW

`AWSOM` stands for: **A**mazing **W**ays to **S**earch and **O**rganise
**M**edia.  `AWSOM` is a media automation toolkit, created by [Peter Fison](https://github.com/PFython) in an effort to automate the Adobe Creative Cloud
video production workflow at [South West London TV]("https://www.southwestlondon.tv").

This Python package contains a mixture of OS-independent Python scripts for managing
common automation tasks such as renaming media files and making backups, as well
as some exciting desktop automations built on top of the superb `Pymiere` library by
[Quentin Masingarbe](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere).  Unfortunately
`Pymiere` currently only works on **Windows 10**, so the corresponding `AWSOM` automations are limited
to Windows users as well (for now).

If you're interested in exploring the rest of the **AWSOM** toolkit, which is
primarily aimed at serious YouTubers, video editors, and power-users of online
video generally such as journalists, researchers, and teachers, please follow us

Both this package and a snazzy new web version of `AWSOM` which we hope to launch soon provide a
tonne of powerful features completely free, but certain 'Pro' features like
Automatic Speech Recognitio/Subtitling use third party services and may require
a registered account with us or them to access on a pay-per-use basis.


## 2. INSTALLATION

Very lightweight with only two dependencies (`cleverdict` and `pymiere`):

    pip install AWSOM

or to cover all bases...

    python -m pip install AWSOM --upgrade --user

## 3. BASIC USE

## 10. UNDER THE BONNET

`AWSOM` makes use of `CleverDict`, a handy custom data type which allows
developers to flexibly switch between Python dictionary `{key: value}` notation
and `object.attribute` notation.  For more information about `CleverDict` see:
https://pypi.org/project/cleverdict/
